## 📊 Overview  

Soulver is a unique combination of a calculator and a notepad, built to handle quick calculations, running totals, estimates, and mathematical notes in a clearer, more intuitive way than traditional calculators. Instead of inputting numbers through rigid equation syntax, Soulver lets you write out expressions in plain language and solves them instantly, making it an ideal tool for planning, budgeting, conversions, financial breakdowns, and any calculation-heavy thinking.

Its line-by-line structure turns each calculation into an editable note. Users can reference previous lines, update values on the fly, and create running calculations without losing clarity or flow. This makes it exceptionally useful for brainstorming with numbers—such as project costs, travel budgets, time estimates, or tax calculations—where values often shift.

Soulver’s smart engine interprets natural-language input, supports variables, understands units, handles dates and time, and performs currency conversions with ease. The app automatically formats calculations, highlights numbers, and keeps a tidy sidebar showing results for each line. With support for percentages, ranges, inline math, and linked expressions, it becomes a powerful thinking tool for both everyday users and professionals.

It offers an elegant interface optimized for clarity. Users can organize sheets, bookmark important calculations, and sync everything across devices. Soulver is widely appreciated by writers, developers, students, accountants, and anyone who prefers flexible, readable calculations over dense spreadsheets or formula-based systems.

With fast processing, live previews, and intelligent parsing, Soulver helps users focus on reasoning, not syntax—turning mathematical thinking into a smooth, natural experience.
